> origins of this repository name: 'pop-UP INfrastructure for EduroaM'

Streamline the building of an eduroam infrastructure with EAP-TLS functionality. Comes packaged with a CLI tool that will make configuration, deployment, and other essential operations simple. Ideated in a fit of annoyance and built with love for all the wonderful people running eduroam all over the world.

Standing on the shoulders of giants; up-in-em utilizes the power of the following awesome open-source projects to satisfy all your eduroam infrastructure needs:
* [FreeRADIUS](https://www.freeradius.org/ "FreeRADIUS"): Fast, feature-rich, modular, and scalable - FreeRADIUS is the most widely used RADIUS server in the world.
* [Vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault "Hashicorp Vault"): A tool for secrets management encryption as a service, and privileged access management.
* \<TBD\>: A CLI tool that eases the operation of freeradius, vault, and other moving parts in your eduroam infrastructure.
